# Customer Management Dashboard (Vite + React + Tailwind)

A modern, minimalistic, and responsive customer management dashboard with:
- Beautiful login screen
- Interactive dashboard with stats
- Customer list, detail, and creation views
- Tailwind CSS styling and a light theme
- Smooth transitions between login and dashboard

## Tech
- Vite (React 18)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router v6
- Zustand for simple state management

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - start dev server on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - build for production
- `npm run preview` - preview production build

## Environment
No external environment variables are required for this demo. Integrate API URLs with environment variables when wiring a backend:
- Example: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com`

## Notes
This demo uses in-memory state. Replace store actions with real API calls as needed.
